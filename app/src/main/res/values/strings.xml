    <string name="blasting_definition">Blasting is the process of treating a surface by propelling particles at high velocity toward it. It is a quick and easy way to remove foreign matter from metal, rubber or plastic. Blasting is generally performed in enclosed environments like blasting chambers or cabinets, or on open sites, for example on buildings, bridges, tanks, boats or mobile plants. Common hazards include dust, hazardous chemicals, and risks associated with the use of plant and equipment. \n Blasting has many variants, including:</string>

In general, painting has two functions. One is to protect the steel surface from corrosion, and the other is to give a good cosmetic appearance. In shipbuilding, special attention is paid to the paint\'s anti-corrosive capability, because it affects the ship\'s life and service performance Surface preparation consists of two stages; the primary and secondary.The primary preparation is shot blasting, sandblasting and grit blasting. Mechanical surface preparation devices powered by compressed air are controlled by a single operator. These mechanical dusting tools are the most widely used in secondary surface preparation. Power tools such as a power brush, disc sander, etc., are mainly applied in secondary preparation.</string>
